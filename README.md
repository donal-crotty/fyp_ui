# UI For Tidal Wave Prediction Tool Final Year Project
## This project incorporates ReactJS, HighchartsJS, Firebase and is developed to interact and pull data from a MySQL DB using the C# backend in 'fyp_backend' repo.

The purpose of my Final Year Project was to develop a responsive web application that would aid personnel working within the Fishing Industry whilst planning voyages and fishing trips.

This application visualized Tidal Wave Prediction Data to help the user decide what days would have the greatest potential of an increased catch and profit.

This application, added with a Thesis with the title "What will be the most beneficial type of data visualization for a user to analyse tidal wave predictions in Ireland?" investigated this concept idea both practically and via research.
